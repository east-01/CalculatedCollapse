Brief Gameplay Description:
Calculated Collapse is a sci fi multiplayer 1v1 tournament style fps game. Two players will be dropped into an arena to fight to the death with a variety of guns, power ups, and throwable pick ups for them to use. The format will be a bo3 to see who can come out on top. Before each round starts. Players will be able to move around their side of the map and choose walls, platforms, and other map assets that they want to remove from the game. This will allow them to come up with a strategy to get an edge on their opponent. We wanted to incorporate some strategy into our game, on top of being a fast paced shooter. Our main focus will be on the multiplayer aspect of the game.
